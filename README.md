# COVID-19_Airbnb_NYC

New York City's otherwise thriving sharing economy, including the short-term housing rental industry, has been severely decimated by the impact of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. This research study uses Airbnb rentals in New York City for September 2018 and September 2021 obtained from insideAirbnb as an example, and through machine learning, we will conduct statistics and analysis on the impact of different factors on the listingsâ€™ availability.
By analyzing how the importance of these different factors changed before and after the coronavirus outbreak, we hope to derive which factors visitors placed more importance on when choosing an Airbnb listing after the outbreak. In this way, we can provide hosts with recommendations to optimize their listings, improve room occupancy, and facilitate the recovery of the short-term housing rental industry in New York City after COVID-19.
